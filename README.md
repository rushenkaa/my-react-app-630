NASA's Astronomical Picture of the Day

We are using the official NASA APOD API to display the picture of the day on this webpage using React. You can use the date picker to view the picture of the day for past dates.

API source- https://api.nasa.gov

For the final submission, we plan on populating a list of images for a range of dates and also render videos.
